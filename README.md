## üìù JSON to PDF

The JSON to PDF magic can be found in `src/components/JSONPDF`

The heavy lifting is done by **[react-pdf](https://github.com/diegomura/react-pdf)** a great project by [diegomura](https://github.com/diegomura) and a lovely JSON editor from [AndrewRedican](https://github.com/AndrewRedican) called **[react-json-editor-ajrm](https://github.com/AndrewRedican/react-json-editor-ajrm)**

## üßê Why Gatsby?

Because It's a wonderful way to set up a SSR/Static React page, and even though the whole front page is client side, I really wanted to have an /about/ page.
