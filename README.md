  JSON to CV
</h1>

A simple React website where you can input your json and the result is a downloadable pdf.

[JSON to CV web](https://jsontocv.com/).

## 🧐 Why Gatsby?

Because It's a wonderful way to set up a SSR/Static React page, and even though the whole front page is client side, I really wanted to have an /about/ page.

The JSON to PDF magic can be found in `src/components/JSONPDF`
